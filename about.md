The Quran is the final book revealed by God for all of mankind. This book is not for Muslims only. This is a book for all people in the human race.

Surah 2, Verse 185. <span style="color:red;">"Ramadaan is the (month) in which was sent down the Quran, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgement (between right and wrong)."</span>

This is my journey learning through the Quran from scratch with the aim of finding all the details and truth in the Quran.
You will see updates to articles I have been researching. English is my first language but that is not stopping me.
My research methodology is as follows:
- Have a question (ie: Why is Prayer important?)
- Read through all the verses.
- Get several translations from Arabic to English in the Quran.
- Interpret and understand what God is saying in those verses.
- Look at meanings of the different words in the various verses in the Quran.
- Resolve the question with a justified answer using verses from the Quran

In future I plan to use latest Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence tools to analyse the Quran even further. To find hidden detail that not even a human is able to find.
