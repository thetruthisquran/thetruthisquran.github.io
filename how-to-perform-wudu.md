<span style="color:red;">And recite [and teach] what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy
Lord: none can change His Words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than
Him.</span> (18:27)

The book has been received and not anybody is this world has changed the words. It is here for a lifetime.

<span style="color:red;">When it is said to them: "Follow what Allah hath revealed:" They say: "Nay!
we shall follow the ways of our fathers." What! even though their fathers Were
void of wisdom and guidance?
</span> (2:170)

When God has given instructions to man, man decided to follow the ways of his father and teachers.

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands
(and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to
the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body.
But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature,
or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for
yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. Allah
doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to
complete His favor to you, that ye may be grateful.</span> (5:6)

The verse that explains how to take ablution in the most simplest manner. 

1. Wash the face
2. Wash the arms to the elbows
3. Wipe the head
4. Wipe the feet to the ankles

If you are dirty, take a bathe or shower to clean your whole body.

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can
understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity [Except when
travelling on the road], until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or
on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in
contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or
earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and
forgive again and again.
</span> (4:43)

Be clear of what you are saying, do not be confused and make sure your mind is there doing prayer.
If Arabic is not your first language, then learning the meaning or say it in the
language of your preference.

If you are sick, travelling, been to the toilet or have had sexual contact with women and there
is no water. Then take clean sand or dust and rub your faces and hands.
