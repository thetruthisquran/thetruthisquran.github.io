<span style="color:red;">So We said: "Strike the [body] with a piece of the [heifer]." Thus Allah
bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may
understand.</span> (2:17)

<span style="color:red;">And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the
Sabbath: We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected."</span> (2:65)

<span style="color:red;">So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a
lesson to those who fear Allah.</span> (2:66)

<span style="color:red;">And remember Moses said to his people: "Allah commands that ye sacrifice a
heifer." They said: "Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?" He said: "Allah save
me from being an ignorant [fool]!"</span> (2:67)

<span style="color:red;">They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what [heifer]
it is!" He said; "He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young,
but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!"</span> (2:68)

<span style="color:red;">They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour."
He said: "He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration
of beholders!"</span> (2:69)

<span style="color:red;">They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is:
To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah wills."</span> (2:70)

<span style="color:red;">He said: "He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the
fields; sound and without blemish." They said: "Now hast thou brought the
truth." Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.</span> (2:71)

<span style="color:red;">Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the
crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.</span> (2:72)

<span style="color:red;">Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of
the night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the
profit of mankind; in the rain which Allah Sends down from the skies, and the
life which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead; in the beasts of all
kinds that He scatters through the earth; in the change of the winds, and the
clouds which they Trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth;- [Here]
indeed are Signs for a people that are wise.</span> (2:164)

<span style="color:red;">There is not an animal [that lives] on the earth, nor a being that flies on
its wings, but [forms part of] communities like you. Nothing have we omitted
from the Book, and they [all] shall be gathered to their Lord in the end.</span> (6:38)

<span style="color:red;">Thou wouldst have deemed them awake, whilst they were asleep, and We turned
them on their right and on their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two
fore-legs on the threshold: if thou hadst come up on to them, thou wouldst have
certainly turned back from them in flight, and wouldst certainly have been
filled with terror of them.</span> (7:18)

<span style="color:red;">So We sent [plagues] on them: Wholesale death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, And
Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance,- a
people given to sin.</span> (7:133)

<span style="color:red;">"And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her to
feed on Allah's [free] earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty
will seize you!"</span> (11:64)

<span style="color:red;">And [He has created] horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride and use for
show; and He has created [other] things of which ye have no knowledge.</span> (16:8)

<span style="color:red;">And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in
[men's] habitations;</span> (16:68)

<span style="color:red;">Then to eat of all the produce [of the earth], and find with skill the
spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of
varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those
who give thought.</span> (16:69)

<span style="color:red;">Thou wouldst have deemed them awake, whilst they were asleep, and We turned
them on their right and on their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two
fore-legs on the threshold: if thou hadst come up on to them, thou wouldst have
certainly turned back from them in flight, and wouldst certainly have been
filled with terror of them.</span> (18:8)

<span style="color:red;">[Some] say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; [others]
say they were five, the dog being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the
unknown; [yet others] say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou:
"My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their [real case]."
Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter
that is clear, nor consult any of them about [the affair of] the Sleepers.</span> (18:22)

<span style="color:red;">He threw it, and behold! It was a snake, active in motion.</span> (20:20)

<span style="color:red;">O men! Here is a parable set forth! listen to it! Those on whom, besides
Allah, ye call, cannot create [even] a fly, if they all met together for the
purpose! and if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have
no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those
whom they petition!</span> (22:73)

<span style="color:red;">"Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving [of its own accord]as
if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps:
"O Moses!" [it was said], "Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called as
messengers have no fear,-</span> (27:10)

<span style="color:red;">And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not the
Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?</span> (27:20)

<span style="color:red;">But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he [came up and] said: "I have compassed
[territory] which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba
with tidings true.</span> (27:22)

<span style="color:red;">"Now do thou throw thy rod!" but when he saw it moving [of its own accord]
as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his
steps: O Moses!" [It was said], "Draw near, and fear not: for thou art of those
who are secure.</span> (28:31)

<span style="color:red;">The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of the
spider, who builds [to itself] a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the
spider's house;- if they but knew.</span> (29:41)

<span style="color:red;">"And be moderate in thy pace, and lower thy voice; for the harshest of
sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass."</span> (31:19)

<span style="color:red;">Fleeing from a lion!</span> (74:51)

<span style="color:red;">Do they not look at the Camels, how they are made?-</span> (88:17)

<span style="color:red;">The [Day] of Noise and Clamour:</span> (101:1)
<span style="color:red;">What is the [Day] of Noise and Clamour?</span> (101:2)
<span style="color:red;">And what will explain to thee what the [Day] of Noise and Clamour is?</span> (101:3)
<span style="color:red;">[It is] a Day whereon men will be like moths scattered about,</span> (101:4)
<span style="color:red;">And the mountains will be like carded wool.</span> (101:5)
<span style="color:red;">Then, he whose balance [of good deeds] will be [found] heavy,</span> (101:6)

These verses indirectly refers to horses. (101:3) Mentions moths as well.

<span style="color:red;">But the Messenger of Allah said to them: "It is a She-camel of Allah! And
[bar her not from] having her drink!"</span> (91:13)

<span style="color:red;">Then they rejected him [as a false prophet], and they hamstrung her. So
their Lord, on account of their crime, obliterated their traces and made them
equal [in destruction, high and low]!</span> (91:14)
