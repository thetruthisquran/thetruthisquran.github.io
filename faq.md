Every human being on earth should study the Quran on their own. This website is a dedication to my understanding and my interpretation of the Quran.
I always give references using the Quran which is how it should it should be done.

May you be guided and may you understand the Quran. The more you read or study in detail, the better you will be at understanding the holy Quran.
Read Chapter 2, Verse 121.

<strong>2) Why did you start this website?</strong>

After years of learning and asking questions to the so-called experts, they were not able to answer simple questions. I decided to study the
Quran and the meaning myself. Read Chapter 2 Verse 121 again, What this means is that the people who study the Quran are the true believers.

<strong>3) The Arabic is quite special and difficult to translate, explain how you would approach this?</strong>

Every Classical Arabic word has a English word to it depending on the context. One Arabic can have several words to it: pen, dog, etc.
Every English can mean something different. This can be from a meaning in those years and a different meaning in the 21st century.
Example: Slavery back then and slavery in modern world is different has a different definition in those two era's.

The best approach would be to look at several meanings of those root Arabic words and see where it fits into context.

<strong>7) Where in the Quran does it say that the Quranic Arabic Language is divine?</strong>
