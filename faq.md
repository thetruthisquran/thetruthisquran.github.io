<strong>1) I disagree with what you are saying.</strong>

Yes, you can disagree all you want. This is my understanding and my interpretation of the Quran. I argue on all sides of the question as well as give references.
May you be guided and may you understand the Quran. The more you read, the better you will be at understanding the holy Quran.

<strong>2) I have a query/issue with a few of the articles and wish to challenge you.</strong>

You can send in the query/issue and I will be glad to answer it. We are all here to learn.

Here is the link to form you can use. [Contact Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw2FuudGMyWGuZLFs26l7rxbGyTxC8GRljylGNN8QkihV9BQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

<strong>3) Why did you start this website?</strong>

After years of learning and asking questions to the so-called experts, they were not able to answer simple questions. I decided to study the
Quran and the meaning myself. Read Surah 2 Verse 121, What this means is that the people who study the Quran are the true believers.

Every Classical Arabic word has a English word to it depending on the context. One Arabic can have several words to it: pen, dog, etc.
Every English can mean something different. This can be from a meaning in those years and a different meaning in the 21st century.
Example: Slavery back then and slavery in modern world is different has a different definition in those two era's.  

This is my interpretation and believe it on your own will.
