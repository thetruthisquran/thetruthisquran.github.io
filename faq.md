<strong>1) I disagree with what you are saying.</strong>

Yes, you can disagree all you want. This is my understanding and my interpretation of the Quran. I argue on all sides of the question as well as give references.
May you be guided and may you understand the Quran. The more you read, the better you will be at understanding the holy Quran.

<strong>2) I have a query/issue with a few of the articles and wish to challenge you.</strong>

You can send in the query/issue and I will be glad to answer it. We are all here to learn.
