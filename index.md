<h1 class="post-title" align="center">Quran Explained</h1>
Answering the most critical questions from the Quran by studying and analysing it verse by verse.

Chapter 2: Verse 121. <span style="color:red;">Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied: They
are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith therein,- the loss is
their own.</span>

Quran is the final book from God. Islam is derived from this book only and no other book must take a higher priority.

Chapter 2: Verse 256. <span style="color:red;">Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error.</span>

There is no compulsion in religion and it should not be forced upon.

Chapter 10: Verse 32. <span style="color:red;">Such is Allah, your real Cherisher and Sustainer: apart from truth, what
[remains] but error? How then are ye turned away?</span>

There is absolute truth in the Quran and any other book to learn about God will lead you to the opposite path.

Chapter 10: Verse 99. <span style="color:red;">If it had been thy Lord's will, they would all have believed,</span>

The Quran is a book that was released for all of mankind for the rest of time.
The book from God does not contradict science. The book describes everything in detail, whatever
is missing from the book is not important. There is always a reason why God left it out.
