The Holy Quran focus to maintain stability by putting life matters into responsive, rearranging priorities accordingly, and coordinate all circles of relationships between the individual and his inner and outer environments:

Several times the main reason why some people fall into depression and may lose the will to live by is due to the lack of weak faith in the divine decree.

Mental illness is mainly explained as a disorder that affects a person's cognitive, social, emotional, behavioral state, or skills. Islam views mental illness as a condition that results from a deranged lifestyle (diet, sleeping routine, spiritual activities, and relation with God) or an unbalanced life.

Recitation of the Holy Quran is a form of spiritual music that gives to the release of endorphins by stimulating alpha brain waves. Therefore, it enhances the stress threshold, removes negative thoughts, and creates a sense of relaxation.

Life is never a bed of roses. We suffer from heartbreak, pain and calamity, any of which might drive us to mental illness and stress. However, at times depression can just be there for no specific reason at all, and when this happens we must seek help for it. God the Creator of the Universe gives The Noble Quran a guide for mankind till the end of time, giving us a guide to help us through any mental problem. Many chapters of the Holy Quran are valuable reading during depression and anxiety, as their meanings and messages can help reduce depression. Quran is the best form of recollection, God might it brings comfort and peace to the heart.

<span style="color:red;">"O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah's Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah's Soothing Mercy, except those who have no faith."</span> [Al-Qur’an 12:87]

Stress is named the illness of new civilization and some of the psychologists call this age as the troubled age. Therefore, according to the Holy Quran finding appropriate ways with stress and providing mental health is very important.

According to Quran, loneliness and hopelessness is impossible due to the belief in Almighty and all-knowing God. The belief is safe and prevented from pain, disappointment, anxiety, etc. His reason in being so is associated with the belief that the almighty God is able to support good enough through him beyond his imagination:

According to the Quran,

<span style="color:red;">O mankind! there hath come to you a direction from your Lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a guidance and a Mercy.</span> [Al-Qur’an 10:57]

<span style="color:red;">Had We sent this as a Qur'an (in the language) other than Arabic, they would have said: "Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! (a Book) not in Arabic and (a Messenger an Arab?" Say: "It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their (eyes): They are (as it were) being called from a place far distant!"</span> [Al-Qur’an 17:82]

So, the first thing that is done for humans by the Holy Quran is to remove him from mental, and social illnesses because this is the best remedy for every pain like mental issues and stress.

Illnesses as the major diseases that cause depression in human life. The Holy Quran fights blasphemy and bad habits in many verses and invites people to the right path. The Holy Quran introduces appropriate ways for some of the social phenomena such as dispersion, persecution, war, poverty, decay and others.

When our sentimental needs are being poorly met, the nafs al-Amara begins to control our feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. The Quran provides guidance to learn and practice relaxation exercises to weaken the impact of the nafs al-Amara. When it is in control, our thoughts are distorted leading us to take things personally, to see everything from a negative point of view, and believe that things can't be changed for the better.

When human moral sense, the nafs al-lawwama is in action, then he becomes aware that something is incorrect with the way we are feeling and behaving. We can face negative thinking leading us to our nafs al-mutmainna. The Holy Quran uses a method called Alif-Lam-Mim for empowering the nafs al-lawwama and help bring about a more soothing state of being. Mindfulness is a modern approach, which focuses on a mental state of awareness, focus, and happiness. Mindfulness is a way in which we can become more aware of ourselves, our thoughts, and our feelings, and act in a way that is mindful of ourselves and others despite our Nafs and desires.

According to Islamic psychology philosophical study of the psyche or the mind from an Islamic perspective, which addresses psychology, neuroscience, philosophy of mind, mental illness and issues. Due to the multi-direction use of words in the Arabic language, it is tough to translate into one peculiar word, but the word nafs lexically refers to our soul, the psyche, heart, or mind. Nafs is used to evaluate our own selves or use it as a synonym of Freud's libido. The second way nafs has been used in the Quran is to refer to a specific part of our self that has desires and hunger. The Islamic concept of nafs highlights the specific and complicated composition of the inner self. Sigmund Freud in the early 1900s described similar states as the id, ego, and superego.

Tolerant is not very easy, but it is necessary for a peaceful life. Combined with prayer and remembrance of Allah, patience will help you get through the difficult times to see that the pieces that were once all up in the air fell into place.

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.</span> [Al-Qur’an 2:153]

God says in the Quran; this world is for difficulties, and with these difficulties and tests, we will grow as people and grow closer to Him. He has also promised that there will be the best reward after every hardship. Look forward to that, know that the condition you are in will not be forever, that you will get through it and that it will feel wonderful when you do.

<span style="color:red;">"But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life narrowed down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment."</span> [Al-Qur’an 2:153]

In short, to sum up we can say that The Holy Quran is the best solution for mental illness and stress. We should recite the Holy Quran daily for a happy and peaceful life.
