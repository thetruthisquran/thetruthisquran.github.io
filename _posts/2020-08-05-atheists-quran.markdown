description: Why atheists should read the Quran?
---

Atheism is identified by the refusal of the existence of a creator. According to Islam, this idea is so insane that the Quran; a handout with it straight a handful of times. As we will see, the particular opinions are extra reasonable by design, but the remaining approach to atheism throughout the text is notably subtle and consistently so. This is because further arguments are interconnected with various other problems human beings face, the least of which is correcting wrong beliefs about God in general. So what does the Quran say about atheism?

In Surah At-Tur, Chapter 52 Verse 35, the Quran asks the reader a set of verbal questions:

<span style="color:red;">Soon will We show them our Signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth), and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord doth witness all things?</span> [Al-Qur’an 41:53]

**Or were they created or produced by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]**

The Holy Quran is conveyed guidance to all of mankind and keeps a treasure open to anyone who approaches it with an open heart and unprejudiced mind. Introducing the Quran to Atheists or non-Muslims; is an endeavor in the direction of presenting a proper introduction of the Quran to Atheists and ignorant Muslims.

If we take Islam as the crucial belief that there is one, supreme Creator and that everything else is only a creation of the Creator with no share in divinity, then a belief in no god at all is contrary to that which is espoused in the Quran. The relationship of the Quran with an atheistic belief is an interesting one in that certain realities absolute to mankind are assumed to be true. In fact, Islam takes the belief in a supreme power as an innate disposition placed in human beings as evidenced by the overwhelming majority of human societies believing this to be the case, even without external factors or influence. However, this does not apply that human societies tend to have the correct beliefs about God; interestingly, the Quran addresses this phenomenon. No believe in Allah and His Messenger, whether that is going with by denial or it is not accompanied by denial but rather doubt, or turning away from faith out of envy or egotism, or because one is following whims and desires that prevent one from following the message.

It should be noted at the start that the very notion of atheism or disbelief is based on the existence and presence of its converse - namely, a religious structure. In other words, it is based around the non-appearance of a belief, and thus compromise evaluation of individuals and groups from a religious starting point. This contrasts with a view of society and belief which proceeds from those parties who declare themselves separate from the religion adopted by their society. Moving forward, we find that within the text of the Quran – which constitutes the highest frame of reference of Islamic legislation – many verses that transfer the utility that the relationship of belief and worship is one between an individual and their God, There is no compulsion in religion.

For atheists, one specific reason for reading the Quran is that it gives a genuine point of reference from which to observe biased stereotypes of Islam to which Westerners are habitually exposed. The Holy Quran is an enduring book for all of mankind, the Quran tells universal questions and problems.

<span style="color:red;">A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat.</span> [Al-Qur’an 36:33]

The Quran is undoubtedly a book of noble importance even to the atheists, perhaps more today than ever if that is realizable. One side of Islam that is unpredicted and yet appealing to the post-Christian secular mind is the harmonious interplay of faith and reason. Islam does not demand unreasoned belief. Rather, it invites bright faith, remarkable, thoughtful, and contemplation, beginning with nature and what is all around us.

Among all mental health disorders in the world, depression is the most constant. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are used to control anxiety in various settings. There is a heightened interest among researchers on religious remedy as to a non-pharmacological intervention for anxiety management. Hence, due to the importance of the Holy Quran in Muslims; lives, atheists also should read the Holy Quran for anxiety and depression because the Holy Quran is the best remedy for all problems. The Holy Quran is the word of Almighty God; it is not a history textbook, it is not a science manual and treasure of wisdom. The Holy Quran proves everything that had gone before it if it was true. It rejects or gets rid of anything that goes before it that was false.

For instance, in one of the Gospels chosen by the Christian church to be part of their canonical scripture, or in the four, it tells us that Jesus is the son of God, although the Holy Quran tells us that he is not.

With the fall of communism, it has become particularly clear that atheists should take global peace, order, and self-determination by reading the Quran, therefore, is that it is an obligatory step toward understanding and tolerance without which world peace is unbelievable.

The Holy Quran narrates three main classes of all people in the world. For all times to come. This is discussed right at the beginning of the Quran

Read the Quran is a very noble act, for atheists. It gives him/her knowledge about all aspects of life, also brings him/her near to the Creator, and will be a justification of the rewards of his/her good deeds on the Day of Judgment.

<span style="color:red;">Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created-</span> [Al-Qur’an 96:1]

<span style="color:red;">Created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood:</span> [Al-Qur’an 96:2]

<span style="color:red;">Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,-</span> [Al-Qur’an 96:3]

<span style="color:red;">He Who taught (the use of) the pen,-</span> [Al-Qur’an 96:4]

<span style="color:red;">Taught man that which he knew not.</span> [Al-Qur’an 96:5]

**Everybody has to start somewhere. Perfection does not happen right away.**

In short, we can say that as human beings, Atheists constantly need someone to talk and to share our problems. They can also find answers while reading the Quran. It is one of the ways how God communicates with us. He sent down guidance or instruction for us 1400 years ago! God mentioned in the Quran in a couple of Surah’s:

**A Book (Holy Quran) we have sent down to you so that you may bring forth mankind from the darkness into the light.**
