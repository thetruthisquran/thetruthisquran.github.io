description: Ancient Egyptian slavery and how it relates in the Quran. From the time of building the Great Pyramids in Giza by Pharoah's slaves.
---

For many years, it was believed that in Ancient Egypt, the Great Pyramids at Giza were built by many thousands of foreign slaves, toiling under very bad conditions for decades. Today, many scholars disprove this picture of ancient Egypt, believing instead that they were built by the free Egyptians themselves, some perhaps as seasonal conscripts with other artisans assign permanently to the projects.

One must also consider just how the Egyptians would control so many slaves in one location with the basic weapons of the Old Kingdom. While the Great Pyramids and early temples of Ancient Egypt were built by paid workers and not slaves, African and Nubian slaves were commonly used during the reign of Ramses II or Ramses the Great, in his vast production of temples. We were slaves to Pharaoh, not Pharaoh's slaves. The former would be only an impartial-social description; the Jews belonged to Pharaoh legally, but spiritually were free people with their minds and an independent approach to reality. However, when we state that someone is; Pharaoh's slave, we recognize his whole personality with Pharaoh. Serving Pharaoh is not just subordinate; it is the whole purpose of his life.

Slavery was ordinary in pre-Islamic times and accepted by many ancient legal systems and it continued under Islam.

Slavery is not something introduced by Islam. It is something that existed since prehistoric times and was a by-product of wars and quarrels between clans and tribes, develop later into an international situation. Of the numerous vices that Islam took upon itself to purify human society, slavery was one of them. Conflicts were very ordinary even before Islam and so was taking prisoners of war into slavery. Conflicts and quarrels continued to break out during the time of the Prophets of Islam and prisoners of war had to be held as part of to initiate peace; holding the disobedience from creating trouble and waging wars.

Prisoners as slaves were according to the principle of exchange without Quran lawmaking. Because had slavery been legislated, Muslims today would be in great self-consciousness after the people of the earth agreed to dismiss it. Islam very much welcomed the termination of slavery.

The holy Quran says about Pharaoh slaves-,

<span style="color:red;">Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore, O Haman! light me a (kiln to bake bricks) out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar!"</span> [Al-Qur’an 28:38]

<span style="color:red;">And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason,- He and his hosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us!</span> [Al-Qur’an 28:39]

Perhaps something injurious is a blessing in disguise. It is the relation of this holy verse from the Quran, which is the root of all compassion and which they want to make in the context of slaughter and terrorism that made me go back and write about it.

<span style="color:red;">Has the story of Moses reached thee?</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:15]

<span style="color:red;">Behold, thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:-</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:16]

<span style="color:red;">"Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds:</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:17]

<span style="color:red;">"And say to him, 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from sin)?-</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:18]

<span style="color:red;">"'And that I guide thee to thy Lord, so thou shouldst fear Him?'"</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:19]

<span style="color:red;">Then did (Moses) show him the Great Sign.</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:20]

<span style="color:red;">But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance);</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:21]

<span style="color:red;">Further, he turned his back, striving hard (against Allah).</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:22]

<span style="color:red;">Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation,</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:23]

<span style="color:red;">Saying, "I am your Lord, Most High".</span> [Al-Qur’an 79:24]

A large number of modern Muslims agree that there is no place for slavery in the present time, there has not been a strong internally developed critique of past or present slaveholding practices. Modern Muslims have generally devoted their attention to thinking about or discussing the religious, ethical, and legal issues related to slavery, because it is difficult to acknowledge and challenge the scriptural and cultural permission for it. Yet it is possible to examine slavery as inconsistent with basic Quran; and precepts of justice and human equality before God. The enslavement of human beings to other human beings is, this is the Quranic point of view. In contrast, slavery of a different type is conceptually central: the status of each Muslim as a slave before God is slavery that can never be eliminated.

**All ancient civilizations have contributed in some way to the evolution of modern society.**

Ancient Egyptians were outstanding reformers. While the pyramids still stand as a reminder of their architectural experienced, the people of ancient Egypt were also responsible for a vast and surprising array of inventions still in use to this day. From innovations in writing and math to the earliest uses of makeup and perfume, civilization had a huge impact on the way people today speak, travel, eat, dress, and more. The slaves in Egypt only in a political-economic way. Had they been slaves theoretical, had they lost their love of freedom and their spiritual heritage, had they been Pharaoh's slaves; and not just; slaves to Pharaoh, they never would have been liberated. They would have lost their personality and their inquiry for freedom. For the Jews, slavery was vanished, not intrinsic. It did not destroy their inner personality. Even in the crucible of slavery and oppression, the Jews had not handover their nobility and devotion. They remained the children of the patriarchs, hoping and praying for a bright future. Since slavery had not corrupted them fully, and since they remained spiritually free, the great miracle of the Exodus took place.

Even as there is no single Quran and verse that calls for the elimination of slavery, many scholars today argue that gradual abolition was the intent of the verses surrounding slavery. Allah asks believers,

<span style="color:red;">And what will explain to thee the path that is steep?-</span> [Al-Qur’an 90:12]

<span style="color:red;">(It is:) freeing the bondman;</span> [Al-Qur’an 90:13]

This verse strongly suggests that it is obligatory on the good to free slaves. If in a society of slaves, every believer is encouraged to free slaves, it is assumed, the slaves of the world would disappear.

When Egypt won a war against another country, there is proof that they brought all of the people from that country back to Egypt to become slaves. Egyptian community was mostly based on passing information from generation to generation and when slaves were added to the social structure, they assumed the same culture. The information that has been translated seems to show the largest growth in slavery during the New Kingdom era. This is when Egypt had a majority of military campaigns and wars and brought slaves back with them.
