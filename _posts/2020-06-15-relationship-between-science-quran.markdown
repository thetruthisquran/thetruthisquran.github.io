description: Scientific evidence, proof and facts of the Quran backed up with scientific verses.

Quran and science have a deep relationship, Many Quranic verses justify the significance of modern science and prove that Quran and science are interconnected and also evoked the attention of Muslim interests.

Today, Modern scientific theory finds itself entirely close to the Quran. There are two major reasons for this consideration. The first is the lack of instability between the Quran and the noticeable circumstances. Science has not been able to produce theories or experiments that deny the Quran. Had our science done so, either our understanding of the Quran or of the world would have been to blame: the Quran itself is accurate in all fields. The second reason for the marvelous relation between the Quran and science is the presence in the Quran itself of very clear and positive encouragement to examine the world around us.

The relation of science and religion is one of the most important associative issues in the World from the past to the present. Any kind of religion generally brought about a new challenging Discussion with science; and the Quran.  According to many thinkers, Quran as the main Islamic Book has a deep relation with science and scientific matters.

Quranic verses also highlight the similarity between science and Quran. For Example, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) highlights the importance of comprehension of science because it is essential and basic knowledge for all people.

According to the well-known physicist and Nobel Prize winner, **Albert Einstein, “Science without religion is disabled. Religion without science is sightless.”, therefore, the Quran, Modern Science are compatible and have a deep connection with each other**.

The Quran is not a book of science but a book of ‘indication’, i.e. Aayaats. There are more than six thousand ‘evidence’ in the Quran of which more than a thousand deal with hard core Science.

# Creation of the Universe known as The Big Bang

The creation of the universe is described by astrophysicists as a universally accepted phenomenon, popularly known as ‘The Big Bang’. It is supported by factual; and experimental data collected by astronomers and astrophysicists for decades. According to ‘The Big Bang’, the whole universe initially one big mass.  Then there was a ‘Big Bang’ which resulted in the establishment of Galaxies and then divided into stars, planets, the sun, the moon, etc.  The emergence of the universe was unique and The Quran contains the following verse regarding big bang theory-

<span style="color:red;">Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?</span> [Al-Qur’an 21:30]

 This fact is a result of the ‘Big Bang’ and was not known to anyone before the prophet-hood of Muhammad (Peace be upon him). Therefore the Quran and science interconnect with each other

# Moonlight is reflected light

It was accepted by earlier civilizations that the moon emerges its light. Science now notifies us that the light of the moon is reflected light. However, this fact was described in the Quran 1,400 years ago in the below verses

<span style="color:red;">Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light;</span> [Al-Quran 25:61]

# The expanding universe

In 1925, American astronomer Edwin Hubble gave observational prove that all galaxies are moving away from one another, which suggested that the universe is expanding. The expansion of the universe is now an accepted scientific fact. This is what the Quran says about the nature of the universe

<span style="color:red;">With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space.</span> [Al-Qur’an 51:47]

In short, the Quran and science are intertwined everywhere.

# The water cycle

In 1580, Bernard Palissy narrated the concept of the ‘water cycle’. He described how water evaporates from the oceans and brisk to form clouds. The clouds move inland where they rise, liquidize, and fall as rain. This water assembles as lakes and streams and flows back to the ocean in a constant cycle.

This is described in the following verses of the Quran

<span style="color:red;">Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of various colours: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly, in this, is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding.</span> [Al-Qur'an 39:21]

# The earth and mountains

The sacred Quranic verse tells us that one of the attributes of the earth upon which we live is that it has large holes and cracks, such that it can be described as such. (The earth, which is characterized by its holes and cracks).

<span style="color:red;">And by the Earth which opens out (for the gushing of springs or the sprouting of vegetation),-</span> [Al-Qur'an 86:12]

Modern science has uncovered the truth of that which the Holy Quran informed over 1400 years ago, such that it has been established that a network of holes stretches across the earth for thousands of kilometers, and this network of holes fully penetrates the earth’s rocky layer to a depth of 65 kilometers.
Modern science has found that the mountains move by the earth’s movement – its confirmed rotation upon its axis as well as its revolution around the sun.

<span style="color:red;">Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of Allah, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for he is well acquainted with all that ye do.</span> [Al-Qur’an, 27:88]

To sum up we can say that The Holy Quran and Prophetic Hadiths informs about amazing scientific facts concerning the heavens, earth, mountains, oceans, mankind, animals, birds, and plants. This was more than 1400 years ago then modern science came with its advanced technology, only to discover the truth and validity of those facts.
