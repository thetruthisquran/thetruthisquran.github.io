description: Why intoxication is bad by using verses from the Quran to explain it.
---

The judgement in Quran is exact and simple. The Quran is complete, perfect, and fully detailed for our lifeline. There is wide acceptance in Muslim thought that the Quran categorically convicted the use of intoxicants. However, there are also some Muslims that declare that as the Quran does not use the condemnation; haram; with respect to alcoholic beverages (as it does for saying swine flesh in 5:3), therefore, it cannot be categorized as forbidden.

The Quran forbids fermented drinks because of their intoxicating effect. For Muslims, all attachment with intoxicating drinks—for instance, buying, selling, and delivering them—is forbidden.

Drinking alcohol and other intoxicants cause hundreds and thousands of people to die every year from addiction brought about by alcohol and drug abuse. Drinking alcohol makes people do acts that they would never consider otherwise. It causes them to forget their duty to Allah Almighty and also move to mental illnesses and causes suicides. While addicted to drinks a person does not take seriously his duties, He forgets his wife, children, parents, and even his Lord. Allah Almighty may punish him or may forgive him.

The central word used by the Quran to describe intoxicants (wine, alcohol, etc.) is khamar. According to the holy Quran, it is clear that khama has both good and bad uses. This does not essentially suggest that khamar is itself bad. Rather, it is the particular context of khamar and its usage that attracts condemnation.

Intoxicant (alcohol) is a worse provision. An example is given:

<span style="color:red;">The Day ye shall see it, every mother giving suck shall forget her suckling-babe, and every pregnant female shall drop her load (unformed): thou shalt see mankind as in a drunken riot, yet not drunk: but dreadful will be the Wrath of Allah.</span> [Al-Qur’an 22:2]

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,- of Satan's handwork: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.</span> [Al-Qur’an 90:5]

<span style="color:red;">And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out wholesome drink and food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise.</span> [Al-Qur’an 90:5]

**On another hand, the verse was more peculiar addressing direct commands regarding khamr and gambling. In this verse, there was a clear command due to which some of the Muslims stop gambling and leave the habit of drinking.**

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again.</span> [Al-Qur’an 4:43]

In all the Quran, intoxication is the only case that relieves the believer in observing the Salat. If a person commits theft, or commits disloyalty, or even commits murder, he/she should still observe his/her Salat. This is because worshipping God is a duty on all believers, whether they commit sins or not.

<span style="color:red;">They ask thee concerning wine and gambling. Say: "In them is great sin, and some profit, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit." They ask thee how much they are to spend; Say: "What is beyond your needs." Thus doth Allah Make clear to you His Signs: In order that ye may consider-</span> [Al-Qur’an 2:219]

According to the Holy, Quran Intoxication is abusive and because of this, people in heaven will not experience it:

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,- of Satan's handwork: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.</span> [Al-Qur’an 5:90]

Gods Messenger (saws) said: Every alcoholic drink is haram! Verily Allah, the superior and sublime, made a compact to those who drank intoxicants to make them drink Tinat al-Khabal. The partner asked: God's Messenger, what is Tinat al-Khabal? He (saws) said: It is the sweat of the local of Hell or the discharge of the denizens of Hell.

There are some ill-mannered and fallacious Muslims who try to assert on the basis of this verse that the Quran and has not exactly forbid Khamr (intoxicants). They tend to forget that it refers to the time before intoxicants were prohibited. Before the prohibition of intoxicants altogether was communicated, it was at least unbecoming that people should come to prayers in a state of intoxication or in an astonishing state of mind on account of drowsiness or some other cause. Islam regards prayers as an address between a Muslim and God. So he is prohibited to approach this monologue while he is drunk. He must clean himself first before he offers Salat. He must be pure in mind and body, therefore, he must be moderate. He must be clean in clothes too.

Modern Muslims are facing an ever-increasing number of dilemmas. One of these is drugs. Intoxicants do not have any advantage for the human body. It is for this reason that none of its parts could be involved in the human body. As soon as it reaches the stomach, alcohol enters the bloodstream, and as it enters the blood, it goes on damaging the white blood corpuscles. Due to this, blood pressure decreases. It may also cause fainting.


Islam allocates with the issue of alcohol and intoxicants in an appropriate way. The guidance relating to the banning of alcohol in Islam is to be acquired directly from the words of Allah alone in the Quran. The prohibition of alcoholic beverages is mentioned many times in the Holy Quran.

They ask about alcohol and games of chance. Say, in both is a great sin, and advantage for men; but the sin of them is greater than their usefulness;

Allah Almighty has narrated using intoxicants, amongst other things, as being awful, and sinful acts of Satan and He has ordered us to abstain from them. Allah, thereafter, states in the next verse, which means: Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avoid you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not obtain? [Quran: 5:91] This Aayah (verse) tells us how it is a hateful act of Satan, because intoxicants, in addition to sowing the seeds of enmity, prevent one from the remembrance of Allah.

To sum up we can say that intoxication is forbidden in the Holy Quran we should avoid the intoxication which is harmful to our health and faith.
