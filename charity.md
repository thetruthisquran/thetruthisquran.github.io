Charity is often combined with prayer in the Quran. The Quran mentions charity over and over which means that it is not a once off activity. It is a consistent  duty of a true
believer.

## Defining Charity

The meaning of charity according to the Oxford dictionary is: "the voluntary giving of help, typically in the form of money, to those in need."
The Quran links charity quite closely with prayer.

<span style="color:red;">And be steadfast in prayer; practise <strong>regular charity </strong>;
and bow down your heads with those who bow down [in worship].</span> (2:43)

<span style="color:red;">And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel [to this
effect]: Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred,
and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer;
and practise <strong>regular charity</strong>. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and
ye backslide [even now].</span> (2:83)

<span style="color:red;">And be steadfast in prayer and <strong>regular in charity</strong>: And whatever good ye
send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah: for Allah
sees Well all that ye do.</span> (2:110)

<span style="color:red;">They ask thee what they should spend [In charity]. Say: Whatever ye spend
that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in want and for
wayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good, -Allah knoweth it well.</span> (2:215)

Spend charity on your parents, family, orphans and those who are in need.

<span style="color:red;">Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed by
injury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing.</span> (2:263)

<span style="color:red;">O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity
or by injury,- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men, but
believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard,
barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it
[Just] a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with aught they have
earned. And Allah guideth not those who reject faith.</span> (2:264)

<span style="color:red;">If ye disclose [acts of] charity, even so it is well, but if ye conceal
them, and make them reach those [really] in need, that is best for you: It will
remove from you some of your [stains of] evil. And Allah is well acquainted with
what ye do.</span> (2:271)

Charity is best given, when it is given privately.

<span style="color:red;">[Charity is] for those in need, who, in Allah's cause are restricted [from
travel], and cannot move about in the land, seeking [For trade or work]: the
ignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are free from want.
Thou shalt know them by their [Unfailing] mark: They beg not importunately from
all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured Allah knoweth it well.</span> (2:273)

<span style="color:red;">Those who [in charity] spend of their goods by night and by day, in secret
and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor
shall they grieve.</span> (2:274)

<span style="color:red;">Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds
of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked.</span> (2:276)

<span style="color:red;">If ye do it not, Take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger: But if ye
turn back, ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly, and ye shall not
be dealt with unjustly.</span> (2:278)

<span style="color:red;">If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time Till it is easy for him to
repay. But if ye remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if ye only
knew.</span> (2:280)

If the person whom you have borrowed money to is in a tough situation. You can freely cancel it and it
will be known for you as charity.

## Loan to God

Loan to God means follow the book of God and obey the rules. When you practice good deeds,
it will not be forgotten. God will double it to your credit.  

<span style="color:red;">Allah did aforetime take a Covenant from the Children of Israel, and We
appointed twelve captains among them. And Allah said: "I am with you: If ye
(but) establish regular Prayers, practice <strong>regular Charity</strong>, believe in My
apostles, honor and assist them, and loan to Allah a beautiful loan, verily I
will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to Gardens with rivers flowing
beneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wandered
from the path of rectitude."</span> (5:13)

<span style="color:red;">Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the
[funds]; for those whose hearts have been [recently] reconciled [to Truth]; for
those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: [thus
is it] ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</span> (9:60)

<span style="color:red;">Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with a
load of debt?-</span> (52:40)

<span style="color:red;">Who is he that will Loan to Allah a beautiful loan? for [Allah] will
increase it manifold to his credit, and he will have [besides] a liberal Reward.</span> (57:11)

<span style="color:red;">So fear Allah as much as you can; listen and obey and spend in charity
for the benefit of your own souls. And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls, -
they are the ones that achieve prosperity.</span> (64:16)

<span style="color:red;">If ye loan to Allah, a beautiful loan, He will double it to your [credit],
and He will grant you Forgiveness: for Allah is most Ready to appreciate
[service], Most Forbearing,-</span> (64:17)

<span style="color:red;">Or is it that thou dost ask them for a reward, so that they are burdened
with a load of debt?-</span> (69:46)

<span style="color:red;">Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth [to prayer] nigh two-thirds of
the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so doth a party of
those with thee. But Allah doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweth
that ye are unable to keep count thereof. So He hath turned to you [in mercy]:
read ye, therefore, of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you. He knoweth
that there may be [some] among you in ill-health; others travelling through the
land, seeking of Allah's bounty; yet others fighting in Allah's Cause, read ye,
therefore, as much of the Qur'an as may be easy [for you]; and establish regular
Prayer and give regular Charity; and loan to Allah a Beautiful Loan. And
whatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find it in Allah's Presence,- yea,
better and greater, in Reward and seek ye the Grace of Allah:
for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span> (73:20)

Charity is a loan to God and the wealth must be spent in God's way.
