One of the most important principles of being a true believer is to prayer or perform Salaah.

## Reasons and benefits for Prayer

<span style="color:red;">But celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostrate
themselves in adoration.</span> (15:98)

Prayer strengthens peoples belief.

<span style="color:red;">And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain.</span> (15:99)

Worship God during your entire life on earth up until you die.

<span style="color:red;">"Verily, I am Allah: There is no god but I: So serve thou Me [only], and
establish regular prayer for celebrating My praise.</span> (20:14)

To show respect for God Almighty by celebration or commemoration.

<span style="color:red;">Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish
regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and
remembrance of Allah is the greatest [thing in life] without doubt. And Allah
knows the [deeds] that ye do.</span> (29:45)

Prayer protects people from doing evil and harm in this world.

<span style="color:red;">Those who rehearse the Book of Allah, establish regular Prayer, and spend
[in Charity] out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope
for a commerce that will never fail:</span> (36:29)

Prayer with charity is the best investment for life after death.

<span style="color:red;">For He will pay them their meed, nay, He will give them [even] more out of
His Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate [service].</span> (36:30)

And will receive even more reward in the Hereafter.
